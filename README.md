# Python Mini Games Project

Welcome to the **Python Mini Games** project! This repository contains multiple Python-based games designed to practice fundamental Python programming skills. The games included are **Hangman**, **Guess the Number (Computer)**, **Guess the Number (User)**, **Madlibs**, and **Rock Paper Scissors**.

## Introduction

This project consists of five classic games implemented in Python. Each game demonstrates core Python concepts such as control flow, loops, functions, user input, and randomization. The games are simple and can be played from the command line, making them a great resource for learning Python.

## Games Included

### 1. Hangman
In **Hangman**, the player has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before losing. The game selects a word randomly from a predefined list of words.

- **Concepts practiced**: String manipulation, loops, lists, and conditionals.
  
### 2. Guess the Number (Computer)
In **Guess the Number (Computer)**, the player picks a number, and the computer will try to guess it within a range. The player will guide the computer by indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

- **Concepts practiced**: Binary search, loops, and user interaction.

### 3. Guess the Number (User)
In **Guess the Number (User)**, the computer selects a random number, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the player is told whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

- **Concepts practiced**: Random number generation, conditionals, and user input.

### 4. Madlibs
In **Madlibs**, the player inputs random words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), which are then inserted into a story template. The game generates a funny story based on the player's inputs.

- **Concepts practiced**: String formatting, input handling, and basic logic.

### 5. Rock Paper Scissors
In **Rock Paper Scissors**, the player competes against the computer in a classic game of chance. The player chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice.

- **Concepts practiced**: Randomization, conditionals, and loops.
